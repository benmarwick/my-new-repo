# This is the parent document

Here are all the contents of the child document

```{r all-from-child, child='child-doc.Rmd'}
```

Here is the output from just one code block in the child document, using `ref.label` (this can be used to refenence blocks with a single document also)

```{r one-chunk-from-child, ref.label='show-the-date', echo=FALSE}
```

# Conclusion

We can embed the output from one Rmd in the middle of another Rmd. 

Child documents are executed in the same environment as the parent document. 

This is handy for doing things like looping over a child document multiple times and running it with different inputs.
